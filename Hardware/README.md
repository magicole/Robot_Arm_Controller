##KiCad Libraries
I used the freetronics KiCad libraries in order to give me a good schematic
symbol and footprint for the Arduino shield. Their GitHub repo can be found here:
https://github.com/freetronics/freetronics_kicad_library
I followed the easy way to install them and the library files are found in the
resources folder of this directory.
